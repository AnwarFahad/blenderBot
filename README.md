# blenderBot
This is a discord bot I created to add onto my discord server. It can be used for finding out the user pings, deleting messages, getting a yes or no answer.

You can type command starting with '.'

Checking Ping: .ping

Deleting messages: .clear 10 - clears 10 messages

Getting a yes or no answer: .should - finish the question {.should I play basketball?}
